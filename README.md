Simple scripts  that I have written, each directory will have a readme explaining what the scripts are and their functionality is.

# IMPORTANT:

This has two repositories, a github one and a gitlab one.  the gitlab one is where all unreleased scripts are stored, github only has released versions that have been merged into the default branch. All PRs/issues in github will be closed and logged in gitlab every so often.  The gitlab repository checks every 180 minutes for new changes and will push if there are any present.

## Repositories: 
[Gitlab repo.](https://gitlab.com/flowalex/scripts)
